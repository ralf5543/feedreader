# Feedreader Project

## Testing Instructions
If you want to test the specs, try to change some content on the app file, like the allFeeds Object,
the body or menu classes, etc.

## Adding tests
For more tests, add them to the jasmine/spec folder, and be sure all tests are independants of one another.
