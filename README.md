# Feedreader Project

## Using Instructions
The feedreader displays the last articles from 4 different feeds. Use the menu button on the top left of the page to display
the feeds, and switch between them.
You can review it on [https://ralf5543.github.io/feedreader/](https://ralf5543.github.io/feedreader/)

## Testing Instructions
If you want to test the specs, try to change some content on the app file, like the allFeeds Object,
the body or menu classes, etc.

## Adding tests
For more tests, add them to the jasmine/spec folder, and be sure all tests are independants of one another.
Separate each component to test in a *describe* function, and write each text in a *it* function.
